## 🎃 Inspiration

Human–wildlife conflict is a serious issue in rural areas, especially at night. Traditional deterrents like firecrackers and fences are unsafe and ineffective. Inspired by Halloween’s eerie energy and the need for real-world protection, we created a spooky-smart torch that blends AI, sound, and light to promote peaceful coexistence.

## 🔦 What It Does

WildGuard AI is a rechargeable handheld torch that:
- Emits red LED flashes to deter wild animals (and ghosts!)
- Simulates flame visuals for non-lethal repulsion
- Plays spooky warning sounds
- Future upgrades include:
  - AI-powered motion detection
  - Species recognition
  - Smart alerts via mobile app
  - Blockchain-based incident logging

## 🛠️ How We Built It

### Hardware
- Red LED arrays (visual deterrence)
- Sound modules (eco-friendly warning noises)
- Flame-simulation visuals
- Rechargeable battery
- Arduino Nano / ESP32 microcontroller

### Software
- Arduino IDE (firmware)
- Firebase (mobile alerts – planned)
- TensorFlow Lite (AI detection – planned)
- Ethereum + IPFS (blockchain logging – planned)

We focused on affordability, portability, and community feedback.
